It's recommended to approach the assignment in the following order:
[ ] Save the configuration file reading until later, after entities are create
[x] Implement the Vec2 class, which you will use for all Components
[x] Implement that basic functionality in the EntityManager class
        Implement the EntityManager's addEntity() and update() funcitons so
        you can start testing the Game class quickly. Don't worry about the update()
        function which removes dead enemies until later when you get more game 
        mechanics working.
[ ] Implement the basics of the Game class:
        a. Construct a player Entity using the spawnPlayer() function
        b. Implement basic drawing of entities using the Game::sRender() function
        c. Construct some enemies using the spawnEnemy() function
        d. Construct a bullet using the spawnBullet() function
[x] Implement Player Movement in Game::sUserInput and Game::sMovement
[ ] Implement the EntityManager::update() function so it deletes dead entities
[ ] Implement the EntityManager::getEntities(tag) functionality
[ ] Implement collisions in sCollision and entity.destroy() if it's dead
[ ] Implement the rest of the game's functionality, including the config file reading
