# Learning C++ Through Game Development.

## Assignment 1: Shapes That Bounce

My first test as a newly born C++ programmer is to make a "game" consisting of bouncing shapes. Though, the actual requirements are a bit more strict and well defined:

1. The Shapes are either Circles or Rectangles and their data (type, name, color, initial position, velocity) are read in from `config`.
2. Shapes must "bounce" off of the walls of the game window.
3. Shape names must be displayed at the center of each Shape.
